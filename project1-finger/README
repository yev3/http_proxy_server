---Server---

To build server:
    $ make fingerserver

And start it with:
    $ ./fingerserver

Server will start and listen for client connections at port 10182 and will run
until closing with Ctrl+C. When Clients connect, a message acknowledging a
connection will display, it will process the Clients' finger requests and send
data back.

--- Client ---

To build the client:
    $ make fingerclient

And run with:
    $ ./fingerclient <username@hostname:server_port>

Client will connect to server using the hostname and server_port (10182 in this
case, and will print out recieved information sent by the server.
