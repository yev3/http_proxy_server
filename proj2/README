NAME
    proxy implementation of Project 2, Milestone 1

SYNOPSIS
     proxy port

DESCRIPTION
    proxy accepts the port number to bind to and listen for http connections.
    It sends the username to the fingerserver running on the specified hostname and port, and displays the information
    received back from the server.

    proxy is designed to run in the background and accept incoming connections.

LIBRARIES USED
    This project uses a header library downloaded from https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL
    The Guideline Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types that are suggested for 
    use by the C++ Core Guidelines maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation. 

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    uses the specified port to listen to

    receives http headers

    First line is the request line in format ZYX as listed in the RFC-ABC

    Only supports the "GET" request type

    Parses the given URL into sections as described on page 6 of RFC-3986
      - scheme
      - authority
      - remaining relative path

    Checks that the scheme specified is "http"
        Responds to user with http 500 status - unsupported scheme

    Authority is further parsed per RFC-2986 page 18:
    authority = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

    Any encountered userinfo sections are discarded as they are part of the request headers

    port is also extracted if present, otherwise set to default value of 80
