## NAME
    proxy - recieves an HTTP request, establishes a TCP connection with the
    requested web server, and recieves and displays the HTTP response.

## SYNOPSIS
    proxy port#

## DESCRIPTION
    Proxy listens on the user-specified port, and when it recieves an HTTP
    request from a client, like:
        GET http://www.cnn.com/ HTTP/1.0

    It parses the client's HTTP request and makes a TCP connection to the
    requested server, and returns the response to the client.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    When proxy receives http headers, it expects the first line to be the
    request line in format listed in the RFC-3986, and only supports
    the "GET" request type.

    It parses the given URL into sections as described on page 6 of RFC-3986
      - scheme
      - authority
      - remaining relative path

    Checks that the scheme specified is "http", if that is not used, it
    responds to the user with HTTP 500 Server Error 
    because the proxy does not support anything other than http://

    Authority is further parsed per RFC-2986 page 18:
    authority = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

    Any encountered user info sections are discarded as they are part of the
    request headers, but port is extracted if present, otherwise it is set to
    a default value of 80.
	
## STRENGTHS
	- Code is extensible and modular
	- Support for multiple clients
	- Partial send of data back to client increases performance (instead of waiting for entire object before send)

## WEAKNESSES
	- No object caching
	- Creating/Deleting threads for every client connection is expensive

## COMPILING
    The following commands are run in the source directory:
    make                Compiles release version of the proxy
    make debug          Compiles the debug version of the proxy, which may print
                        additional diagnostic information to the console.
    make clean          Removes the executable and object files to start fresh

## Contributions
### Zachary Madigan
	- Parsing of http request and creation of request to send to server
	- Researched different strategies to increase performance
	- Helped implement read/write strategy of sending server's response back to the client
