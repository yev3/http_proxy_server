NAME
    proxy - recieves an HTTP request, establishes a TCP connection with the requested web
    server, and recieves and displays the HTTP response.

SYNOPSIS
    proxy port#

DESCRIPTION
    proxy listens on the user-specified port, and when it recieves
    an HTTP request from a client, like:
        GET http://www.cnn.com/ HTTP/1.0
        
        
    It parses the client's HTTP request and makes a TCP connection to the 
    requested server, and displays the response from the web server. It runs
    continuously until exited using Ctrl + C.

LIBRARIES USED
    This project uses a header library downloaded from https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL
    The Guideline Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types that are suggested for 
    use by the C++ Core Guidelines maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation. 

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    When proxy receives http headers, it expects the first line to be the
    request line in format ZYX as listed in the RFC-ABC, and only supports
    the "GET" request type.

    It parses the given URL into sections as described on page 6 of RFC-3986
      - scheme
      - authority
      - remaining relative path

    Checks that the scheme specified is "http", if that is not used, it
    responds to the user with "Request is not http://".

    Authority is further parsed per RFC-2986 page 18:
    authority = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

    Any encountered user info sections are discarded as they are part of the
    request headers, but port is extracted if present, otherwise it is set to
    a default value of 80.

    The proxy also uses logging, provided by this library:
